# Key EDA Insights

Below are the major findings from our exploratory data analysis. These insights are drawn from various visualizations including time-series trends, moving averages, FFT analysis, distribution plots, and correlation heatmaps.

## 1. Time-Series Trends & Moving Averages

- **Overall Sales Trend (2011–2016):**  
  Daily sales data show a general upward trend with noticeable fluctuations over time.
  
- **7-Day & 30-Day Moving Averages:**  
  - The 7-day moving average highlights weekly seasonality.
  - The 30-day moving average captures broader, monthly variations.

**Key Takeaway:**  
Walmart’s sales display both short-term (weekly) and long-term (monthly/seasonal) patterns.

## 2. Power Spectrum Analysis (FFT)

- **Dominant Cycles Identified:**  
  - A significant peak at the **7-day** mark confirms strong weekly seasonality.
  - Minor peaks at other intervals (e.g., ~6 days, ~190+ days) suggest additional cyclical behaviors.
  
- **Log-Scale Analysis:**  
  Using a log scale helps reveal hidden cyclical patterns in the sales data.

**Key Takeaway:**  
The sales data exhibit strong weekly cycles, and the FFT analysis may help in uncovering additional seasonal patterns.

## 3. Rolling Standard Deviation & Distribution

- **Rolling Standard Deviation:**  
  - Variability in daily sales changes over different windows (e.g., 3-day vs. 30-day).
  - Periodic spikes hint at effects from promotions or holidays.
  
- **Sales Distribution:**  
  - The data is right-skewed, with most days showing moderate sales and some days showing spikes.
  - A log-transformed distribution appears more symmetric.

**Key Takeaway:**  
Sales volatility is not constant. A log transformation might stabilize variance and improve predictive modeling.

## 4. Weekday Patterns (Example: Store TX_3)

- **Weekly Sales Patterns:**  
  - Higher sales are observed on weekends (e.g., Saturday) with lower sales on some weekdays (e.g., Monday).
  - A trendline shows a gradual upward trend over the week.

**Key Takeaway:**  
Understanding day-of-week effects is crucial for optimizing inventory and staffing at individual stores.

---

## 5. Correlation Heatmap (Example: Store CA_1)

- **Lag & Rolling Feature Correlations:**  
  - Strong correlations exist between certain lagged features (e.g., lag_7) and rolling means (e.g., rolling_mean_7).
  - Some rolling standard deviations (e.g., rolling_std_14 vs. rolling_std_30) indicate overlapping information.

**Key Takeaway:**  
Lagged features and rolling statistics effectively capture the recurring weekly patterns, though some may be redundant.

---

## 6. Impact of Events on Sales

- **Event vs. Non-Event Days:**  
  - Sales differ on days with special events or promotions.
  - The effect of events is store-dependent, reflecting localized factors.

**Key Takeaway:**  
Incorporating event-based features is essential to accurately forecast sales, as holidays and promotions can significantly affect performance.

## Overall Conclusions

1. **Strong Weekly Seasonality:**  
   Both moving averages and FFT confirm a 7-day cycle.
2. **Right-Skewed Distribution:**  
   A log transformation is recommended to handle skewness.
3. **Event & Holiday Effects:**  
   Special events have a marked impact on sales.
4. **Feature Redundancy:**  
   Lagged and rolling features are useful but may overlap, so careful feature selection is required.

These insights guide our feature engineering and model selection to improve forecasting accuracy.
