## 1. Time-Series Trends & Moving Averages

- **Overall Sales Trend (2011â€“2016):**  
  Daily sales show a general upward trajectory, with some notable fluctuations over time.

- **7-Day & 30-Day Moving Averages:**  
  - **7-day MA** highlights weekly seasonality.  
  - **30-day MA** captures broader, monthly variations.

**Key Takeaway:**
Walmartâ€™s sales exhibit both short-term (weekly) and longer-term (monthly or seasonal) patterns. These moving averages confirm recurring demand cycles, as well as an overall growth trend.

## 2. Time-Series Decomposition Analysis

1. **Original Series (Blue)**  
   - Raw daily sales from 2011 to 2016.  
   - Noticeable spikes often coincide with holidays, promotions, or other anomalies.

2. **Trend Component (Red)**  
   - Reflects the long-term movement in sales.  
   - Overall upward slope indicates steady growth, with occasional dips or rebounds.

3. **Seasonal Component (Green)**  
   - Captures repeating cycles (e.g., weekly, annual).  
   - Consistent peaks/troughs often align with weekends, holidays, or monthly shopping habits.

4. **Residual Component (Black)**  
   - What remains after removing trend and seasonality.  
   - Ideally appears random; large spikes may suggest unmodeled events or outliers.

**Key Takeaway:**
- Strong Weekly/Monthly Seasonality: Repeating cycles confirm a regular pattern in sales volumes.  
- Overall Growth Trend: A steady upward slope, though some periods show slower growth.  
- Residual Spikes: Indicate events or promotions that arenâ€™t captured by simple trend/seasonality modeling.

- **7-day**

## 3. Power Spectrum Analysis (FFT)

- **Dominant Cycles Identified:**  
  - A **6â€“7 day** cycle highlights a strong weekly pattern.  
  - Weekly seasonality is common in retail and e-commerce (weekend vs. weekday shopping).

**Key Takeaway on Model Selection:**
- Prophet: Automatically handles yearly and weekly seasonality.  
- SARIMA / SARIMAX: Manages one or two major seasonalities (weekly, yearly), but multiple overlapping cycles can be complex.  
- Tree Models (LightGBM / XGBoost): Require feature engineering (e.g., sine/cosine transformations) to capture dominant periods.

## 4. Variance Analysis

- **Rolling Standard Deviation:**  
  - Reveals how sales volatility changes over different windows (3-day vs. 30-day).  
  - Periodic spikes may reflect promotions or holiday effects.

- **Sales Distribution:**  
  - Right-skewed distribution with moderate daily sales and occasional spikes.  
  - Log-Transformed distribution is more symmetric, often aiding modeling.

**Key Takeaway:**
Sales volatility is not constant. A log transform can help stabilize variance, and capturing volatility patterns (via rolling std) may improve forecast accuracy.

## 5. Variance Stability Test

**Key Takeaway:**
The variance stability tests indicate that the original data has stable variance, as confirmed by both Bartlettâ€™s and Leveneâ€™s tests. However, the log transformation introduces instability, as Bartlettâ€™s test reports a significant p-value, while Leveneâ€™s test suggests otherwise. In contrast, the Box-Cox transformation effectively stabilizes variance, with both tests yielding high p-values, confirming its suitability for variance normalization. The Box-Cox lambda value of approximately 0.95 suggests minimal transformation was needed.

## 5. Weekday Patterns (Store TX_3, WI_1)

- **Weekly Sales Patterns:**  
  - Typically higher sales on weekends (e.g., Saturday) vs. certain weekdays (e.g., Monday).  
  - Trendlines show a gradual rise over the week.

**Key Takeaway:**
Including weekday features is essential to capture these intra-week fluctuations and plan inventory or staffing accordingly.

## 6. Correlation Heatmap on Rolling & Lagged Features (Store CA_1, TX_1)

- **Lag & Rolling Feature Correlations:**  
  - Certain lags (e.g., lag_7) and rolling means (e.g., rolling_mean_7) are strongly correlated.  
  - Some rolling std features (e.g., rolling_std_14 vs. rolling_std_30) overlap.

**Key Takeaway:**
While lagged and rolling features capture weekly patterns, too many similar features can introduce redundancy. **PCA** or careful feature selection may be necessary to avoid overfitting.

## 7. Impact of Events on Sales

- **Event vs. Non-Event Days:**  
  - Special events or promotions can significantly shift sales.  
  - The effect varies by store, highlighting regional or demographic factors.

**Key Takeaway:**
Incorporating holiday or event-based features is crucial for accurate forecasting. Such days often create sales spikes or dips beyond normal trends.

## Overall Conclusions

1. Model Selection
  - Prophet: Automatically models weekly and yearly seasonality; ideal for strong weekly cycles and holiday effects.
  - SARIMA/SARIMAX: Effective for one or two dominant seasonalities (e.g., weekly, yearly) but may struggle with overlapping cycles.
  - Tree-Based Models (LightGBM/XGBoost): Powerful for non-linear relationships; require engineered features (e.g., sine/cosine transformations) to capture cyclicality.
  - Decomposition Approaches: Choose additive vs. multiplicative models based on whether seasonal effects remain constant or grow with the trend.

2. Feature Engineering
  - Lagged & Rolling Features: Use lags (e.g., lag_7) and rolling averages/stds to capture recurring weekly patterns and volatility. Though PCA might be needed to reduce redundancy.
  - Cyclical Transformations: Create sine and cosine features to represent 6â€“7 day cycles.
  - Event-Based Features: Add binary flags or dummy variables for holidays and promotions to capture event-driven effects.
  - Distribution Transformations: Apply log transformation to stabilize variance in right-skewed sales data.
  - Weekday Patterns: Include day-of-week as a categorical variable to capture differences between weekdays and weekends.

These insights guide our feature engineering and model selection to improve forecasting accuracy.
