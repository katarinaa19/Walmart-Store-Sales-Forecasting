# 📊 Predictive Sales Analytics for Walmart

# 📌 Overview  

## **Business Background**  
Sales patterns fluctuate across different seasons, directly affecting a company's profitability. Accurate sales forecasting allows businesses to anticipate demand, optimize inventory, and make strategic financial decisions. Without it, companies risk overstocking, revenue losses, and missed investment opportunities.  

For Walmart, one of the world's largest retailers, precise sales predictions are crucial for:  
✅ Maintaining optimal stock levels and minimizing excess inventory costs  
✅ Enhancing revenue forecasting for better financial planning  
✅ Supporting data-driven pricing and investment strategies  
✅ Boosting investor confidence by meeting or exceeding sales targets  

## **Objective**  
This project focuses on developing predictive models to forecast sales in Walmart’s hobbies product category for the next 27 days (from April 25, 2016, to May 21, 2016). With accurate forecasts, Walmart authorities can:  
📦 Optimize stock management and reduce unnecessary inventory costs  
📈 Improve revenue forecasting for better financial planning  
💡 Make strategic investment decisions based on demand trends  

## **Dataset**
