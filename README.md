# Retail Sales Forecasting for Walmart’s Hobbies Category

# 🌟 Overview  

## **📊Business Background**  
Sales patterns fluctuate across different seasons, directly affecting a company's profitability. Accurate sales forecasting allows businesses to anticipate demand, optimize inventory, and make strategic financial decisions. Without it, companies risk overstocking, revenue losses, and missed investment opportunities.  

For Walmart, one of the world's largest retailers, precise sales predictions are crucial for:  
✅ Maintaining optimal stock levels and minimizing excess inventory costs  
✅ Enhancing revenue forecasting for better financial planning  
✅ Supporting data-driven pricing and investment strategies  
✅ Boosting investor confidence by meeting or exceeding sales targets  

## **🎯Objective**  
This project aims to develop predictive models to forecast sales in Walmart’s hobbies product category over the next 27 days (from April 25, 2016, to May 21, 2016). The approach combines time series analysis and machine learning techniques to capture trends, seasonality, and demand fluctuations.
- By leveraging accurate sales forecasts, Walmart can:
- Optimize stock management to prevent overstocking and shortages
- Enhance revenue forecasting for more precise financial planning
- Support data-driven investment decisions based on projected demand

## **📂Dataset**  
- **Data Description**: This dataset contains historical sales records from 45 Walmart stores across various regions. Each store consists of multiple departments. Throughout the year, Walmart holds promotional markdown events, typically leading up to major holidays. The four most significant holidays—Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas—have a greater impact on sales, with weeks containing these holidays receiving five times the weight in evaluation compared to regular weeks.
- **Key Features**  
  - Time-Series Data: Daily sales records for multiple products over several years  
  - Store & Product Details: Information on different Walmart stores and product categories  
  - Price Data: Historical pricing information for various products
  - Calendar Data: Includes events, holidays, and other factors influencing sales trends

# 💡 Key EDA Insights*

EDA insights guide our feature engineering and model selection, ensuring models align closely with business objectives and deliver improved forecasting accuracy.

- Model Selection
  - Prophet: Automatically models weekly and yearly seasonality; ideal for strong weekly cycles and holiday effects.
  - SARIMA/SARIMAX: Effective for one or two dominant seasonalities (e.g., weekly, yearly) but may struggle with overlapping cycles.
  - Tree-Based Models (LightGBM/XGBoost): Powerful for non-linear relationships; require engineered features (e.g., sine/cosine transformations) to capture cyclicality.
  - Decomposition Approaches: Choose additive vs. multiplicative models based on whether seasonal effects remain constant or grow with the trend.

- Feature Engineering
  - Lagged & Rolling Features: Use lags (e.g., lag_7) and rolling averages/stds to capture recurring weekly patterns and volatility.
  - Cyclical Transformations: Create sine and cosine features to represent 6–7 day cycles.
  - Event-Based Features: Add binary flags or dummy variables for holidays and promotions to capture event-driven effects.
  - Distribution Transformations: Apply log transformation to stabilize variance in right-skewed sales data.
  - Weekday Patterns: Include day-of-week as a categorical variable to capture differences between weekdays and weekends.
